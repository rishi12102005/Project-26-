              HOW TO MAKE WHITE PASTA CHESSE
7: Use a steel Pan for making the sauce.
Add 2 tableSpoons butter.

8: As soon as the butter melts,add 1 teaspoon grated 
garlic(optional) and fry for 30 to 40 seconds. Then immediately add 1 and a half tablespoons all-purpose flour.

9: Turn down the heat to low to medium.
Saute well until the flour loses the raw smell, for about minute.
Make sure the color of the flour does not change.
This step is very important.
Since this is a small Quantity, the roux can become 
dry and crumpy. It is fine.

10: Lowe the flame completely and slowly pour 1/4 cup milk.

11: Begin to incorporate the roux into the milk using a
whisk or a spatula.

12: Dissolve the flour completely to creamy sauce.
Ensure the flame is low at this stage.

13: Once you see a smooth sauce,free of lumps, pour the rest of the milk(1 1/4 cups) in 2 batches and stir.
Simmer(on a low flame) until the white sauce thickens.
Keep stirring and scrape the sides for a uniform sauce.

14:To check if the white sauce is done perfectly,dip a spoon well.
Alternately you can draw a line with your finger on the back of the spoon, you should see it clean with space.
This means it is thick enough.

15:Add 2 to 3 tbsps chesse(optional),pepper and oregano.You can also add a pinch of ground nutmeg if you want. You can use parmesan or cheddar or cream chesse.

16: Mix untill chesse blends well and looks like a rich,creamy and smooth sauce.
Turn off. Do not overheat the white sauce. 
Taste test and add more salt and herbs if needed

17: Add vegetables(I specifed above) and cooked pasta to the White sauce. Mix everything together.

18: If the sauce looks too thick(as it cools down), add 2tbsp of the reserved stock or water so the sauce loosens a bit.

19: Garnish white sauce pasta with read chilli flakes and crushed black pepper.
Serve it immediately as the sauce thickens more as it cools down.
